Model: https://github.com/atulkum/co-attention/blob/master/code/model.py

Batcher: https://github.com/atulkum/co-attention/blob/master/code/data_util/data_batcher.py


### TODOS
- [x] Forward Pass (Kuba)
- [x] Backward Pass (Kuba)
- [x] Debug why predicted end indices are all 0 (Richie)
- [x] Complete batching (Asmita)
- [x] Training pipeline (Asmita)
- [x] Move tests to seperate file (Richie)
