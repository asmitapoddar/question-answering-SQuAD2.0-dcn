At age eight , Beyoncé and childhood friend Kelly Rowland met LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group . They were placed into a group with three other girls as Girl 's Tyme , and rapped and danced on the talent show circuit in Houston . After seeing the group , R&B producer Arne Frager brought them to his Northern California studio and placed them in Star Search , the largest talent show on national TV at the time . Girl 's Tyme failed to win , and Beyoncé later said the song they performed was not good . In 1995 Beyoncé 's father resigned from his job to manage the group . The move reduced Beyoncé 's family 's income by half , and her parents were forced to move into separated apartments . Mathew cut the original line-up to four and the group continued performing as an opening act for other established R&B girl groups . The girls auditioned before record labels and were finally signed to Elektra Records , moving to Atlanta Records briefly to work on their first recording , only to be cut by the company . This put further strain on the family , and Beyoncé 's parents separated . On October 5 , 1995 , Dwayne Wiggins 's Grass Roots Entertainment signed the group . In 1996 , the girls began recording their debut album under an agreement with Sony Music , the Knowles family reunited , and shortly after , the group got a contract with Columbia Records .
