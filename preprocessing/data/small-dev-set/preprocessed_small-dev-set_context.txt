The Normans ( Norman : Nourmands ; French : Normands ; Latin : Normanni ) were the people who in the 10th and 11th centuries gave their name to Normandy , a region in France . They were descended from Norse ( " Norman " comes from " Norseman " ) raiders and pirates from Denmark , Iceland and Norway who , under their leader Rollo , agreed to swear fealty to King Charles III of West Francia . Through generations of assimilation and mixing with the native Frankish and Roman-Gaulish populations , their descendants would gradually merge with the Carolingian-based cultures of West Francia . The distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the Normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries .

The Norman dynasty had a major political , cultural and military impact on medieval Europe and even the Near East . The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Christian piety , becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated . They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled , their dialect becoming known as Norman , Normaund or Norman French , an important literary language . The Duchy of Normandy , which they formed by treaty with the French crown , was a great fief of medieval France , and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure . The Normans are noted both for their culture , such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions , and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations . Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines , and an expedition on behalf of their duke , William the Conqueror , led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 . Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East , where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant , to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain , to Ireland , and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands .

The English name " Normans " comes from the French words Normans/Normanz , plural of Normant , modern French normand , which is itself borrowed from Old Low Franconian Nortmann " Northman " or directly from Old Norse Norðmaðr , Latinized variously as Nortmannus , Normannus , or Nordmannus ( recorded in Medieval Latin , 9th century ) to mean " Norseman , Viking " .

In the course of the 10th century , the initially destructive incursions of Norse war bands into the rivers of France evolved into more permanent encampments that included local women and personal property . The Duchy of Normandy , which began in 911 as a fiefdom , was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo , and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria . The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions . The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine , but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine . The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen , and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II ( part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis ) .

The Duchy of Normandy , which began in 911 as a fiefdom , was established by the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo , and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria . The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions . The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine , but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine . The territory was roughly equivalent to the old province of Rouen , and reproduced the Roman administrative structure of Gallia Lugdunensis II ( part of the former Gallia Lugdunensis ) .
Before Rollo 's arrival , its populations did not differ from Picardy or the Île-de-France , which were considered " Frankish " . Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s , but were divided between colonies in the east ( Roumois and Pays de Caux ) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the Cotentin Peninsula , and were separated by traditional pagii , where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers . Rollo 's contingents who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the Atlantic coast included Danes , Norwegians , Norse – Gaels , Orkney Vikings , possibly Swedes , and Anglo-Danes from the English Danelaw under Norse control .

The descendants of Rollo 's Vikings and their Frankish wives would replace the Norse religion and Old Norse language with Catholicism ( Christianity ) and the Gallo-Romance language of the local people , blending their maternal Frankish heritage with Old Norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique " Norman " culture in the north of France . The Norman language was forged by the adoption of the indigenous langue d'oïl branch of Romance by a Norse-speaking ruling class , and it developed into the regional language that survives today .

The Normans thereafter adopted the growing feudal doctrines of the rest of France , and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both Normandy and in England . The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old French aristocracy , most of whom traced their lineage to Franks of the Carolingian dynasty . Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry , and by 1066 Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation . Many Normans of Italy , France and England eventually served as avid Crusaders under the Italo-Norman prince Bohemund I and the Anglo-Norman king Richard the Lion-Heart .

Soon after the Normans began to enter Italy , they entered the Byzantine Empire and then Armenia , fighting against the Pechenegs , the Bulgars , and especially the Seljuk Turks . Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines , but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily . They were prominent alongside Varangian and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of George Maniaces in 1038 – 40 . There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy , and it now seems likely only a few came from there . It is also unknown how many of the " Franks " , as the Byzantines called them , were Normans and not other Frenchmen .

One of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was Hervé in the 1050s . By then however , there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as Trebizond and Georgia . They were based at Malatya and Edessa , under the Byzantine duke of Antioch , Isaac Komnenos . In the 1060s , Robert Crispin led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks . Roussel de Bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in Asia Minor with support from the local population , but he was stopped by the Byzantine general Alexius Komnenos .

Some Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenians vassal-states of Sassoun and Taron in far eastern Anatolia . Later , many took up service with the Armenian state further south in Cilicia and the Taurus Mountains . A Norman named Oursel led a force of " Franks " into the upper Euphrates valley in northern Syria . From 1073 to 1074 , 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general Philaretus Brachamius were Normans — formerly of Oursel — led by Raimbaud . They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle : Afranji , meaning " Franks . " The known trade between Amalfi and Antioch and between Bari and Tarsus may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy .

Several families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the Comnenian Restoration , when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors . The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul , the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps , and that group of Albanian clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under George Maniaces in the Sicilian expedition of 1038 .

Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty , and relating those classes to each other . A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer , which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps , such as an algorithm .

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources , whatever the algorithm used . The theory formalizes this intuition , by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them , such as time and storage . Other complexity measures are also used , such as the amount of communication ( used in communication complexity ) , the number of gates in a circuit ( used in circuit complexity ) and the number of processors ( used in parallel computing ) . One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and can not do .

One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and can not do .
Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory . A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem , whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem . More precisely , it tries to classify problems that can or can not be solved with appropriately restricted resources . In turn , imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory : the latter theory asks what kind of problems can , in principle , be solved algorithmically .

A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance . The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance , and should not be confused with the problem itself . In computational complexity theory , a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved . In contrast , an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance , which can serve as the input for a decision problem . For example , consider the problem of primality testing . The instance is a number ( e.g. 15 ) and the solution is " yes " if the number is prime and " no " otherwise ( in this case " no " ) . Stated another way , the instance is a particular input to the problem , and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input .

To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance , consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem : Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany 's 15 largest cities ? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem , such as asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km . For this reason , complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances .

When considering computational problems , a problem instance is a string over an alphabet . Usually , the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet ( i.e. , the set { 0,1 } ) , and thus the strings are bitstrings . As in a real-world computer , mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded . For example , integers can be represented in binary notation , and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices , or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary .

Decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory . A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no , or alternately either 1 or 0 . A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language , where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes , and the non-members are those instances whose output is no . The objective is to decide , with the aid of an algorithm , whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration . If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes , the algorithm is said to accept the input string , otherwise it is said to reject the input .

A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no , or alternately either 1 or 0 . A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language , where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes , and the non-members are those instances whose output is no . The objective is to decide , with the aid of an algorithm , whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration . If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes , the algorithm is said to accept the input string , otherwise it is said to reject the input .

An example of a decision problem is the following . The input is an arbitrary graph . The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected , or not . The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs — of course , to obtain a precise definition of this language , one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings .

It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems . However , this is not really the case , since function problems can be recast as decision problems . For example , the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples ( a , b , c ) such that the relation a × b = c holds . Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers .

To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem , one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem . However , the running time may , in general , depend on the instance . In particular , larger instances will require more time to solve . Thus the time required to solve a problem ( or the space required , or any measure of complexity ) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance . This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits . Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size . For instance , in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected , how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices ?

" Southern California " is not a formal geographic designation , and definitions of what constitutes southern California vary . Geographically , California 's north-south midway point lies at exactly 37 ° 9 ' 58.23 " latitude , around 11 miles ( 18 km ) south of San Jose ; however , this does not coincide with popular use of the term . When the state is divided into two areas ( northern and southern California ) , the term " southern California " usually refers to the ten southern-most counties of the state . This definition coincides neatly with the county lines at 35 ° 47 ′ 28 ″ north latitude , which form the northern borders of San Luis Obispo , Kern , and San Bernardino counties . Another definition for southern California uses Point Conception and the Tehachapi Mountains as the northern boundary .

Though there is no official definition for the northern boundary of southern California , such a division has existed from the time when Mexico ruled California , and political disputes raged between the Californios of Monterey in the upper part and Los Angeles in the lower part of Alta California . Following the acquisition of California by the United States , the division continued as part of the attempt by several pro-slavery politicians to arrange the division of Alta California at 36 degrees , 30 minutes , the line of the Missouri Compromise . Instead , the passing of the Compromise of 1850 enabled California to be admitted to the Union as a free state , preventing southern California from becoming its own separate slave state .

Instead , the passing of the Compromise of 1850 enabled California to be admitted to the Union as a free state , preventing southern California from becoming its own separate slave state .

Following a lengthy legal battle with the European Commission , which deemed the exclusivity of the rights to be against the interests of competition and the consumer , BSkyB 's monopoly came to an end from the 2007 – 08 season . In May 2006 , the Irish broadcaster Setanta Sports was awarded two of the six Premier League packages that the English FA offered to broadcasters . Sky picked up the remaining four for £ 1.3 bn . In February 2015 , Sky bid £ 4.2 bn for a package of 120 premier league games across the three seasons from 2016 . This represented an increase of 70 % on the previous contract and was said to be £ 1bn more than the company had expected to pay . The move has been followed by staff cuts , increased subscription prices ( including 9 % in Sky 's family package ) and the dropping of the 3D channel .

BSkyB initially charged additional subscription fees for using a Sky + PVR with their service ; waiving the charge for subscribers whose package included two or more premium channels . This changed as from 1 July 2007 , and now customers that have Sky + and subscribe to any BSkyB subscription package get Sky + included at no extra charge . Customers that do not subscribe to BSkyB 's channels can still pay a monthly fee to enable Sky + functions . In January 2010 BSkyB discontinued the Sky + Box , limited the standard Sky Box to Multiroom upgrade only and started to issue the Sky + HD Box as standard , thus giving all new subscribers the functions of Sky + . In February 2011 BSkyB discontinued the non-HD variant of its Multiroom box , offering a smaller version of the SkyHD box without Sky + functionality . In September 2007 , Sky launched a new TV advertising campaign targeting Sky + at women . As of 31 March 2008 , Sky had 3,393,000 Sky + users .

In 2007 , BSkyB and Virgin Media became involved in a dispute over the carriage of Sky channels on cable TV .

The service started on 1 September 1993 based on the idea from the then chief executive officer , Sam Chisholm and Rupert Murdoch , of converting the company business strategy to an entirely fee-based concept . The new package included four channels formerly available free-to-air , broadcasting on Astra 's satellites , as well as introducing new channels . The service continued until the closure of BSkyB 's analogue service on 27 September 2001 , due to the launch and expansion of the Sky Digital platform . Some of the channels did broadcast either in the clear or soft encrypted ( whereby a Videocrypt decoder was required to decode , without a subscription card ) prior to their addition to the Sky Multichannels package . Within two months of the launch , BSkyB gained 400,000 new subscribers , with the majority taking at least one premium channel as well , which helped BSkyB reach 3.5 million households by mid-1994 . Michael Grade criticized the operations in front of the Select Committee on National Heritage , mainly for the lack of original programming on many of the new channels .

Immigrants arrived from all over the world to search for gold , especially from Ireland and China . Many Chinese miners worked in Victoria , and their legacy is particularly strong in Bendigo and its environs . Although there was some racism directed at them , there was not the level of anti-Chinese violence that was seen at the Lambing Flat riots in New South Wales . However , there was a riot at Buckland Valley near Bright in 1857 . Conditions on the gold fields were cramped and unsanitary ; an outbreak of typhoid at Buckland Valley in 1854 killed over 1,000 miners .

Prior to European settlement , the area now constituting Victoria was inhabited by a large number of Aboriginal peoples , collectively known as the Koori . With Great Britain having claimed the entire Australian continent east of the 135th meridian east in 1788 , Victoria was included in the wider colony of New South Wales . The first settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at Sullivan Bay , and much of what is now Victoria was included in the Port Phillip District in 1836 , an administrative division of New South Wales . Victoria was officially created a separate colony in 1851 , and achieved self-government in 1855 . The Victorian gold rush in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased both the population and wealth of the colony , and by the Federation of Australia in 1901 , Melbourne had become the largest city and leading financial centre in Australasia . Melbourne also served as capital of Australia until the construction of Canberra in 1927 , with the Federal Parliament meeting in Melbourne 's Parliament House and all principal offices of the federal government being based in Melbourne .

Huguenot numbers peaked near an estimated two million by 1562 , concentrated mainly in the southern and central parts of France , about one-eighth the number of French Catholics . As Huguenots gained influence and more openly displayed their faith , Catholic hostility grew , in spite of increasingly liberal political concessions and edicts of toleration from the French crown . A series of religious conflicts followed , known as the Wars of Religion , fought intermittently from 1562 to 1598 . The wars finally ended with the granting of the Edict of Nantes , which granted the Huguenots substantial religious , political and military autonomy .

A term used originally in derision , Huguenot has unclear origins . Various hypotheses have been promoted . The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues ( died 1532 ) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time , using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten ( literally housemates ) , referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse ( Confederates as in " a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy " ) . Geneva was John Calvin 's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement . In Geneva , Hugues , though Catholic , was a leader of the " Confederate Party " , so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation . The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators ( all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church ) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560 : a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise . The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss . Thus , Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot , a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France . [ citation needed ]

The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France . The country had a long history of struggles with the papacy by the time the Protestant Reformation finally arrived . Around 1294 , a French version of the Scriptures was prepared by the Roman Catholic priest , Guyard de Moulin . A two-volume illustrated folio paraphrase version based on his manuscript , by Jean de Rély , was printed in Paris in 1487 .

Montpellier was among the most important of the 66 " villes de sûreté " that the Edict of 1598 granted to the Huguenots . The city 's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots . Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622 . Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city 's fortifications . A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party . Even before the Edict of Alès ( 1629 ) , Protestant rule was dead and the ville de sûreté was no more . [ citation needed ]

The city 's political institutions and the university were all handed over to the Huguenots . Tension with Paris led to a siege by the royal army in 1622 . Peace terms called for the dismantling of the city 's fortifications . A royal citadel was built and the university and consulate were taken over by the Catholic party . Even before the Edict of Alès ( 1629 ) , Protestant rule was dead and the ville de sûreté was no more . [ citation needed ]
Individual Huguenots settled at the Cape of Good Hope from as early as 1671 with the arrival of François Villion ( Viljoen ) . The first Huguenot to arrive at the Cape of Good Hope was however Maria de la Queillerie , wife of commander Jan van Riebeeck ( and daughter of a Walloon church minister ) , who arrived on 6 April 1652 to establish a settlement at what is today Cape Town . The couple left for the Far East ten years later . On 31 December 1687 the first organised group of Huguenots set sail from the Netherlands to the Dutch East India Company post at the Cape of Good Hope . The largest portion of the Huguenots to settle in the Cape arrived between 1688 and 1689 in seven ships as part of the organised migration , but quite a few arrived as late as 1700 ; thereafter , the numbers declined and only small groups arrived at a time .

Barred by the government from settling in New France , Huguenots led by Jessé de Forest , sailed to North America in 1624 and settled instead in the Dutch colony of New Netherland ( later incorporated into New York and New Jersey ) ; as well as Great Britain 's colonies , including Nova Scotia . A number of New Amsterdam 's families were of Huguenot origin , often having emigrated as refugees to the Netherlands in the previous century . In 1628 the Huguenots established a congregation as L'Église française à la Nouvelle-Amsterdam ( the French church in New Amsterdam ) . This parish continues today as L'Eglise du Saint-Esprit , part of the Episcopal ( Anglican ) communion , and welcomes Francophone New Yorkers from all over the world . Upon their arrival in New Amsterdam , Huguenots were offered land directly across from Manhattan on Long Island for a permanent settlement and chose the harbor at the end of Newtown Creek , becoming the first Europeans to live in Brooklyn , then known as Boschwick , in the neighborhood now known as Bushwick .

In the early years , many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston , South Carolina . In 1685 , Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France , was among the first to settle there . He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city . After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 , several Huguenot families of Norman and Carolingian nobility and descent , including Edmund Bohun of Suffolk England from the Humphrey de Bohun line of French royalty descended from Charlemagne , Jean Postell of Dieppe France , Alexander Pepin , Antoine Poitevin of Orsement France , and Jacques de Bordeaux of Grenoble , immigrated to the Charleston Orange district . They were very successful at marriage and property speculation . After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies , they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper , Ashepoo , Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger . Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas , where they developed new plantations .

After petitioning the British Crown in 1697 for the right to own land in the Baronies , they prospered as slave owners on the Cooper , Ashepoo , Ashley and Santee River plantations they purchased from the British Landgrave Edmund Bellinger . Some of their descendants moved into the Deep South and Texas , where they developed new plantations .
In the early years , many Huguenots also settled in the area of present-day Charleston , South Carolina . In 1685 , Rev. Elie Prioleau from the town of Pons in France , was among the first to settle there . He became pastor of the first Huguenot church in North America in that city .

Stadtholder William III of Orange , who later became King of England , emerged as the strongest opponent of king Louis XIV after the French attacked the Dutch Republic in 1672 . William formed the League of Augsburg as a coalition to oppose Louis and the French state . Consequently , many Huguenots considered the wealthy and Calvinist Dutch Republic , which led the opposition to Louis XIV , as the most attractive country for exile after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes . They also found many French-speaking Calvinist churches there .

Renewed religious warfare in the 1620s caused the political and military privileges of the Huguenots to be abolished following their defeat . They retained the religious provisions of the Edict of Nantes until the rule of Louis XIV , who progressively increased persecution of them until he issued the Edict of Fontainebleau ( 1685 ) , which abolished all legal recognition of Protestantism in France , and forced the Huguenots to convert . While nearly three-quarters eventually were killed or submitted , roughly 500,000 Huguenots had fled France by the early 18th century [ citation needed ] .

The Catholic Church in France and many of its members opposed the Huguenots . Some Huguenot preachers and congregants were attacked as they attempted to meet for worship . The height of this persecution was the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre when 5,000 to 30,000 were killed , although there were also underlying political reasons for this as well , as some of the Huguenots were nobles trying to establish separate centers of power in southern France . Retaliating against the French Catholics , the Huguenots had their own militia .

By 1620 the Huguenots were on the defensive , and the government increasingly applied pressure . A series of three small civil wars known as the Huguenot rebellions broke out , mainly in southwestern France , between 1621 and 1629 . revolted against royal authority . The uprising occurred a decade following the death of Henry IV , a Huguenot before converting to Catholicism , who had protected Protestants through the Edict of Nantes . His successor Louis XIII , under the regency of his Italian Catholic mother Marie de ' Medici , became more intolerant of Protestantism . The Huguenots respond by establishing independent political and military structures , establishing diplomatic contacts with foreign powers , and openly revolting against central power . The rebellions were implacably suppressed by the French Crown . [ citation needed ]

Steam engines are external combustion engines , where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products . Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power , nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used . The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle . In the cycle , water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure . When expanded through pistons or turbines , mechanical work is done . The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler .

The first commercially successful true engine , in that it could generate power and transmit it to a machine , was the atmospheric engine , invented by Thomas Newcomen around 1712 . It was an improvement over Savery 's steam pump , using a piston as proposed by Papin . Newcomen 's engine was relatively inefficient , and in most cases was used for pumping water . It worked by creating a partial vacuum by condensing steam under a piston within a cylinder . It was employed for draining mine workings at depths hitherto impossible , and also for providing a reusable water supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable " head " . Water that had passed over the wheel was pumped back up into a storage reservoir above the wheel .

The first full-scale working railway steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in the United Kingdom and , on 21 February 1804 , the world 's first railway journey took place as Trevithick 's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway from the Pen-y-darren ironworks , near Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in south Wales . The design incorporated a number of important innovations that included using high-pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency . Trevithick visited the Newcastle area later in 1804 and the colliery railways in north-east England became the leading centre for experimentation and development of steam locomotives .

The Rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water , so that they may be run continuously . Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps ; however , other types are used . Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector , which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler . Injectors became popular in the 1850s but are no longer widely used , except in applications such as steam locomotives .

It is a logical extension of the compound engine ( described above ) to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency . The result is the multiple expansion engine . Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively . These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter . These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage . As with the double expansion engine , if space is at a premium , then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage . Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline , but various other formations were used . In the late 19th century , the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing ' system ' was used on some marine triple expansion engines . Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders , one at each end of the engine . This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced , resulting in a smoother , faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration . This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners ( such as the Olympic class ) , but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine .

In the 1840s and 50s , there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate , variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve ; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff . The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events , at the expense of increased friction and wear , and the mechanism tended to be complicated . The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side , with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred . This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson , Joy and Walschaerts motions . Corliss , and later , poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events ; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms .

This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson , Joy and Walschaerts motions . Corliss , and later , poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events ; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms .
In the 1840s and 50s , there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate , variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve ; the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff .

Lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boiler 's firebox . If the water level drops , such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly , the lead melts and the steam escapes , warning the operators , who may then manually suppress the fire . Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire . The plugs are also too small in area to lower steam pressure significantly , depressurizing the boiler . If they were any larger , the volume of escaping steam would itself endanger the crew . [ citation needed ]

In 1781 James Watt patented a steam engine that produced continuous rotary motion . Watt 's ten-horsepower engines enabled a wide range of manufacturing machinery to be powered . The engines could be sited anywhere that water and coal or wood fuel could be obtained . By 1883 , engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible . The stationary steam engine was a key component of the Industrial Revolution , allowing factories to locate where water power was unavailable . The atmospheric engines of Newcomen and Watt were large compared to the amount of power they produced , but high pressure steam engines were light enough to be applied to vehicles such as traction engines and the railway locomotives .

The history of the steam engine stretches back as far as the first century AD ; the first recorded rudimentary steam engine being the aeolipile described by Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria . In the following centuries , the few steam-powered " engines " known were , like the aeolipile , essentially experimental devices used by inventors to demonstrate the properties of steam . A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din in 1551 and by Giovanni Branca in 1629 . Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont received patents in 1606 for fifty steam powered inventions , including a water pump for draining inundated mines . Denis Papin , a Huguenot refugee , did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679 , and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690 .

A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al-Din in 1551 and by Giovanni Branca in 1629 . Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont received patents in 1606 for fifty steam powered inventions , including a water pump for draining inundated mines . Denis Papin , a Huguenot refugee , did some useful work on the steam digester in 1679 , and first used a piston to raise weights in 1690 .

Near the end of the 19th century compound engines came into widespread use . Compound engines exhausted steam in to successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures , giving improved efficiency . These stages were called expansions , with double and triple expansion engines being common , especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried . Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century , when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating ( piston ) steam engines , with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine .

The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century . Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines ( for outputs above several hundred horsepower ) , have fewer moving parts , and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means . Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century , where their efficiency , higher speed appropriate to generator service , and smooth rotation were advantages . Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines . In the United States 90 % of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources . Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century .

Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8 . It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms compounds ( notably oxides ) with most elements . By mass , oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe , after hydrogen and helium . At standard temperature and pressure , two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen , a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula O 2 . Diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8 % of the Earth 's atmosphere . However , monitoring of atmospheric oxygen levels show a global downward trend , because of fossil-fuel burning . Oxygen is the most abundant element by mass in the Earth 's crust as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide , making up almost half of the crust 's mass .

Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and fats , contain oxygen , as do the major inorganic compounds that are constituents of animal shells , teeth , and bone . Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water , the major constituent of lifeforms . Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis , which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water . It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms . Another form ( allotrope ) of oxygen , ozone ( O 3 ) , strongly absorbs UVB radiation and consequently the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation , but is a pollutant near the surface where it is a by-product of smog . At even higher low earth orbit altitudes , sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause erosion for spacecraft .

Many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms , such as proteins , nucleic acids , carbohydrates , and fats , contain oxygen , as do the major inorganic compounds that are constituents of animal shells , teeth , and bone . Most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as it is a part of water , the major constituent of lifeforms . Oxygen is used in cellular respiration and released by photosynthesis , which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water . It is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms .

In the late 17th century , Robert Boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion . English chemist John Mayow ( 1641 – 1679 ) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus . In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air 's volume before extinguishing the subjects . From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion .

English chemist John Mayow ( 1641 – 1679 ) refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus or just nitroaereus . In one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the air 's volume before extinguishing the subjects . From this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion .

In the meantime , on August 1 , 1774 , an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide ( HgO ) inside a glass tube , which liberated a gas he named " dephlogisticated air " . He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it . After breathing the gas himself , he wrote : " The feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air , but I fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards . " Priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled " An Account of Further Discoveries in Air " which was included in the second volume of his book titled Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air . Because he published his findings first , Priestley is usually given priority in the discovery .

One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics , Philo of Byzantium . In his work Pneumatica , Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel 's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck . Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass . Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo 's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration .

One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics , Philo of Byzantium . In his work Pneumatica , Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessel 's neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck . Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass . Many centuries later Leonardo da Vinci built on Philo 's work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration .

Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion . Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity ; an ignition event , such as heat or a spark , is needed to trigger combustion . Oxygen is the oxidant , not the fuel , but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion . Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential , such as peroxides , chlorates , nitrates , perchlorates , and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire .

Concentrated O 2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically . Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel ; and therefore the design and manufacture of O 2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized . The fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure O 2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure , instead of the 1⁄3 normal pressure that would be used in a mission .

Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) . The Earth 's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon ( silica SiO 2 , as found in granite and quartz ) , aluminium ( aluminium oxide Al 2O 3 , in bauxite and corundum ) , iron ( iron ( III ) oxide Fe 2O 3 , in hematite and rust ) , and calcium carbonate ( in limestone ) . The rest of the Earth 's crust is also made of oxygen compounds , in particular various complex silicates ( in silicate minerals ) . The Earth 's mantle , of much larger mass than the crust , is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron .

John Dalton 's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another . For example , Dalton assumed that water 's formula was HO , giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen , instead of the modern value of about 16 . In 1805 , Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen ; and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of water 's composition , based on what is now called Avogadro 's law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules .

John Dalton 's original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another . For example , Dalton assumed that water 's formula was HO , giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen , instead of the modern value of about 16 .

Highly combustible materials that leave little residue , such as wood or coal , were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston ; whereas non-combustible substances that corrode , such as iron , contained very little . Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory , nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea ; instead , it was based on observations of what happens when something burns , that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process . The fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products . Indeed , one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals , too , gain weight in rusting ( when they were supposedly losing phlogiston ) .

In this dioxygen , the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other . The bond can be variously described based on level of theory , but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms , the filling of which results in a bond order of two . More specifically , the double bond is the result of sequential , low-to-high energy , or Aufbau , filling of orbitals , and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons , after sequential filling of the low σ and σ * orbitals ; σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the O-O molecular axis and π overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the O-O molecular axis , and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest π and π * orbitals .

The 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OAPEC , consisting of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria ) proclaimed an oil embargo . By the end of the embargo in March 1974 , the price of oil had risen from US$ 3 per barrel to nearly $ 12 globally ; US prices were significantly higher . The embargo caused an oil crisis , or " shock " , with many short - and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy . It was later called the " first oil shock " , followed by the 1979 oil crisis , termed the " second oil shock . "

By the end of the embargo in March 1974 , the price of oil had risen from US$ 3 per barrel to nearly $ 12 globally ; US prices were significantly higher . The embargo caused an oil crisis , or " shock " , with many short - and long-term effects on global politics and the global economy .

The crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within NATO . Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott . Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents . To address this , the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants . They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights . By January 18 , 1974 , US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula . The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974 .

On August 15 , 1971 , the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord . The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar , whose value was left to " float " ( rise and fall according to market demand ) . Shortly thereafter , Britain followed , floating the pound sterling . The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies . Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time , the industrialized nations increased their reserves ( by expanding their money supplies ) in amounts far greater than before . The result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations ' currencies . Because oil was priced in dollars , oil producers ' real income decreased . In September 1971 , OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that , from then on , they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold .

In September 1971 , OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that , from then on , they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold .
On August 15 , 1971 , the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord . The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar , whose value was left to " float " ( rise and fall according to market demand ) . Shortly thereafter , Britain followed , floating the pound sterling . The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies .

This contributed to the " Oil Shock " . After 1971 , OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation . From 1947 to 1967 , the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year . Until the oil shock , the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities . OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions , so their real incomes lagged . The substantial price increases of 1973 – 1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold .

On October 6 , 1973 , Syria and Egypt , with support from other Arab nations , launched a surprise attack on Israel , on Yom Kippur . This renewal of hostilities in the Arab – Israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices . At the time , Iran was the world 's second-largest oil exporter and a close US ally . Weeks later , the Shah of Iran said in an interview : " Of course [ the price of oil ] is going to rise ... Certainly ! And how ! ... You 've [ Western nations ] increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent , and the same for sugar and cement ... You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us , refined as petrochemicals , at a hundred times the price you 've paid us ... It 's only fair that , from now on , you should pay more for oil . Let 's say ten times more . "

You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us , refined as petrochemicals , at a hundred times the price you 've paid us ... It 's only fair that , from now on , you should pay more for oil . Let 's say ten times more . "
In response to American aid to Israel , on October 16 , 1973 , OPEC raised the posted price of oil by 70 % , to $ 5.11 a barrel . The following day , oil ministers agreed to the embargo , a cut in production by five percent from September 's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met . On October 19 , Nixon requested Congress to appropriate $ 2.2 billion in emergency aid to Israel , including $ 1.5 billion in outright grants . George Lenczowski notes , " Military supplies did not exhaust Nixon 's eagerness to prevent Israel 's collapse ... This [ $ 2.2 billion ] decision triggered a collective OPEC response . " Libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the United States . Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil-producing states joined the embargo on October 20 , 1973 . At their Kuwait meeting , OAPEC proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the US as a " principal hostile country " .

In the United States , scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973 . The possibility that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern to the US than oil . Further , interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for Kissinger 's dominance . In the US production , distribution and price disruptions " have been held responsible for recessions , periods of excessive inflation , reduced productivity , and lower economic growth . "

The embargo had a negative influence on the US economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to U.S. energy security . On an international level , the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries , such as automobiles . Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts . The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies , even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic . Finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production .

The embargo was not uniform across Europe . Of the nine members of the European Economic Community ( EEC ) , the Netherlands faced a complete embargo , the UK and France received almost uninterrupted supplies ( having refused to allow America to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the Arabs and the Israelis ) , while the other six faced partial cutbacks . The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel , and Harold Wilson 's government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War . His successor , Ted Heath , reversed this policy in 1970 , calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders .

The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel , and Harold Wilson 's government supported the Israelis during the Six-Day War . His successor , Ted Heath , reversed this policy in 1970 , calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre-1967 borders .

Although the European Union does not have a codified constitution , like every political body it has laws which " constitute " its basic governance structure . The EU 's primary constitutional sources are the Treaty on European Union ( TEU ) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) , which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states . The Treaties establish the EU 's institutions , list their powers and responsibilities , and explain the areas in which the EU can legislate with Directives or Regulations . The European Commission has the initiative to propose legislation . During the ordinary legislative procedure , the Council ( which are ministers from member state governments ) and the European Parliament ( elected by citizens ) can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass . The Commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce EU law . The " European Council " ( rather than the Council , made up of different government Ministers ) is composed of the Prime Ministers or executive Presidents of the member states . It appoints the Commissioners and the board of the European Central Bank . The European Court of Justice is the supreme judicial body which interprets EU law , and develops it through precedent . The Court can review the legality of the EU institutions ' actions , in compliance with the Treaties . It can also decide upon claims for breach of EU laws from member states and citizens .

The primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties , the " core " treaties being the Treaty on European Union ( TEU ) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) . The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions , which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states . The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states , as well as certain islands and overseas territories , including Madeira , the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments . European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations , for example Gibraltar and the Åland islands . The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions , as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon . The TEU specifically excludes certain regions , for example the Faroe Islands , from the jurisdiction of European Union law . Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force , unless stated otherwise , and are generally concluded for an unlimited period . The TEU provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply . [ vague ] All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation , as stated in the TEU , whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives . The Court of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Treaties , but it can not rule on their validity , which is subject to international law . Individuals may rely on primary law in the Court of Justice of the European Union if the Treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear , precise and unconditional .

The primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties , the " core " treaties being the Treaty on European Union ( TEU ) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ( TFEU ) . The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions , which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states . The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states , as well as certain islands and overseas territories , including Madeira , the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments . European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations , for example Gibraltar and the Åland islands . The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions , as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon . The TEU specifically excludes certain regions , for example the Faroe Islands , from the jurisdiction of European Union law .

The principal Treaties that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel , and then atomic energy , but more complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 ( now : TFEU ) . Minor amendments were made during the 1960s and 1970s . Major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single , internal market in the Single European Act 1986 , to further the development of a more social Europe in the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997 , and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the EU institutions in the Treaty of Nice 2001 and the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 . Since its establishment , more member states have joined through a series of accession treaties , from the UK , Ireland , Denmark and Norway in 1972 ( though Norway did not end up joining ) , Greece in 1979 , Spain and Portugal 1985 , Austria , Finland , Norway and Sweden in 1994 ( though again Norway failed to join , because of lack of support in the referendum ) , the Czech Republic , Cyprus , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004 , Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and Croatia in 2013 . Greenland signed a Treaty in 1985 giving it a special status .

Following the Nice Treaty , there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the European Union and make it more transparent ; this would have also produced a single constitutional document . However , as a result of the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands , the 2004 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe never came into force . Instead , the Lisbon Treaty was enacted . Its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty , but it was formally an amending treaty , and – though it significantly altered the existing treaties – it did not completely replace them .

The European Commission is the main executive body of the European Union . Article 17 ( 1 ) of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should " promote the general interest of the Union " while Article 17 ( 3 ) adds that Commissioners should be " completely independent " and not " take instructions from any Government " . Under article 17 ( 2 ) , " Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal , except where the Treaties provide otherwise . " This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure , although the Council is the " de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives " . The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion , giving reasons . The Commission 's President ( currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister , Jean-Claude Juncker ) sets the agenda for the EU 's work . Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote , usually through a " written procedure " of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections . [ citation needed ] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 , there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states , including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy ( currently Federica Mogherini ) . The Commissioners ( and most importantly , the portfolios they will hold ) are bargained over intensively by the member states . The Commissioners , as a block , are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve , and majority approval of the Parliament . The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament , was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon .

Commissioners have various privileges , such as being exempt from member state taxes ( but not EU taxes ) , and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts . Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices , particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999 , and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations . This resulted in one main case , Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job , for which he was clearly unqualified , did in fact not break any law . By contrast to the ECJ 's relaxed approach , a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had ‘ even the slightest sense of responsibility ’ . This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office . In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health , John Dalli , who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a € 60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive . Beyond the Commission , the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro . It has a six-person board appointed by the European Council , on the Council 's recommendation . The President of the Council and a Commissioner can sit in on ECB meetings , but do not have voting rights .

Commissioners have various privileges , such as being exempt from member state taxes ( but not EU taxes ) , and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts . Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices , particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999 , and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations . This resulted in one main case , Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job , for which he was clearly unqualified , did in fact not break any law .

The second main legislative body is the Council , which is composed of different ministers of the member states . The heads of government of member states also convene a " European Council " ( a distinct body ) that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the ' necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities ' . It meets each six months and its President ( currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk ) is meant to ' drive forward its work ' , but it does not itself ' legislative functions ' . The Council does this : in effect this is the governments of the member states , but there will be a different minister at each meeting , depending on the topic discussed ( e.g. for environmental issues , the member states ' environment ministers attend and vote ; for foreign affairs , the foreign ministers , etc. ) . The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions . When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size , so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states . In total there are 352 votes , but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote , if not consensus . TEU article 16 ( 4 ) and TFEU article 238 ( 3 ) define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members ( not votes ) representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU : currently this means around 74 per cent , or 260 of the 352 votes . This is critical during the legislative process .

The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions .

To make new legislation , TFEU article 294 defines the " ordinary legislative procedure " that applies for most EU acts . The essence is there are three readings , starting with a Commission proposal , where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs ( not just those present ) to block or suggest changes , and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes , but by unanimity to block Commission amendment . Where the different institutions can not agree at any stage , a " Conciliation Committee " is convened , representing MEPs , ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text : if this works , it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority . This means , legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament , a minority in the Council , and a majority in the Commission : it is harder to change EU law than stay the same . A different procedure exists for budgets . For " enhanced cooperation " among a sub-set of at least member states , authorisation must be given by the Council . Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure . The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties . TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred , although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question : who ultimately has the " competence " to define the EU 's " competence " . Many member state courts believe they decide , other member state Parliaments believe they decide , while within the EU , the Court of Justice believes it has the final say .

To make new legislation , TFEU article 294 defines the " ordinary legislative procedure " that applies for most EU acts . The essence is there are three readings , starting with a Commission proposal , where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs ( not just those present ) to block or suggest changes , and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes , but by unanimity to block Commission amendment . Where the different institutions can not agree at any stage , a " Conciliation Committee " is convened , representing MEPs , ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text : if this works , it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority . This means , legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament , a minority in the Council , and a majority in the Commission : it is harder to change EU law than stay the same . A different procedure exists for budgets . For " enhanced cooperation " among a sub-set of at least member states , authorisation must be given by the Council .

The judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law , by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties , and accelerating economic and political integration . Today the Court of Justice of the European Union ( CJEU ) is the main judicial body , within which there is a higher European Court of Justice ( commonly abbreviated as ECJ ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance , and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance . There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues , and then a separate Court of Auditors . Under the Treaty on European Union article 19 ( 2 ) there is one judge from each member state , 28 at present , who are supposed to " possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices " ( or for the General Court , the " ability required for appointment to high judicial office " ) . A president is elected by the judges for three years . Under TEU article 19 ( 3 ) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law . In fact , most EU law is applied by member state courts ( the English Court of Appeal , the German Bundesgerichtshof , the Belgian Cour du travail , etc. ) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling . The CJEU 's duty is to " ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed " , although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate . Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments , including Van Gend en Loos , Mangold v Helm , and Kadi v Commission .

The judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law , by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties , and accelerating economic and political integration . Today the Court of Justice of the European Union ( CJEU ) is the main judicial body , within which there is a higher European Court of Justice ( commonly abbreviated as ECJ ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance , and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance . There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues , and then a separate Court of Auditors . Under the Treaty on European Union article 19 ( 2 ) there is one judge from each member state , 28 at present , who are supposed to " possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices " ( or for the General Court , the " ability required for appointment to high judicial office " ) .

The Amazon rainforest ( Portuguese : Floresta Amazônica or Amazônia ; Spanish : Selva Amazónica , Amazonía or usually Amazonia ; French : Forêt amazonienne ; Dutch : Amazoneregenwoud ) , also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle , is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America . This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres ( 2,700,000 sq mi ) , of which 5,500,000 square kilometres ( 2,100,000 sq mi ) are covered by the rainforest . This region includes territory belonging to nine nations . The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil , with 60 % of the rainforest , followed by Peru with 13 % , Colombia with 10 % , and with minor amounts in Venezuela , Ecuador , Bolivia , Guyana , Suriname and French Guiana . States or departments in four nations contain " Amazonas " in their names . The Amazon represents over half of the planet 's remaining rainforests , and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world , with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species .

This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres ( 2,700,000 sq mi ) , of which 5,500,000 square kilometres ( 2,100,000 sq mi ) are covered by the rainforest . This region includes territory belonging to nine nations . The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil , with 60 % of the rainforest , followed by Peru with 13 % , Colombia with 10 % , and with minor amounts in Venezuela , Ecuador , Bolivia , Guyana , Suriname and French Guiana . States or departments in four nations contain " Amazonas " in their names .

Following the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent . From 66 – 34 Mya , the rainforest extended as far south as 45 ° . Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics . During the Oligocene , for example , the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band . It expanded again during the Middle Miocene , then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum . However , the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods , allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species .

During the mid-Eocene , it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch . Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic , while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin . As the Andes Mountains rose , however , a large basin was created that enclosed a lake ; now known as the Solimões Basin . Within the last 5 – 10 million years , this accumulating water broke through the Purus Arch , joining the easterly flow toward the Atlantic .

There is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM ) and subsequent deglaciation . Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present , and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin . There is debate , however , over how extensive this reduction was . Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland ; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east than is seen today . This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin , and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data .

Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland ; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east than is seen today . This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin , and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data .

For a long time , it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated , as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil . Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea , as described in her book Amazonia : Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise . She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 0.52 / sq mi ) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting , with agriculture needed to host a larger population . However , recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated . Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500 , divided between dense coastal settlements , such as that at Marajó , and inland dwellers . By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000 .

Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500 , divided between dense coastal settlements , such as that at Marajó , and inland dwellers . By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000 .
For a long time , it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated , as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil .

The first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542 . The BBC 's Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana , rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought , was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s . It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe , such as smallpox . Since the 1970s , numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 0 – 1250 , furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations . Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre . The BBC 's Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest , rather than being a pristine wilderness , has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta .

The first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542 . The BBC 's Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana , rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought , was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s . It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe , such as smallpox . Since the 1970s , numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 0 – 1250 , furthering claims about Pre-Columbian civilizations .

Terra preta ( black earth ) , which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest , is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management . The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment ; meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management , rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed . In the region of the Xingu tribe , remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida . Among those were evidence of roads , bridges and large plazas .

The biodiversity of plant species is the highest on Earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer ( 62 acres ) of Ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species . A study in 1999 found one square kilometer ( 247 acres ) of Amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants . The average plant biomass is estimated at 356 ± 47 tonnes per hectare . To date , an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued . The total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000 .
